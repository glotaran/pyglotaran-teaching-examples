Teaching examples inherited from paramGUI

## Introduction

This repository holds some python notebooks (.ipynb) used in teaching the concepts behind the modelling of time-resolved spectroscopy measurements. These examples are inspired by the functionality of [paramGUI](https://github.com/glotaran/paramGUI), a `Shiny` based R-Package for teaching parameter estimation examples inspired by time-resolved spectroscopy.
